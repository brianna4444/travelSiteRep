Jamaica

One of my favorite islands is Jamaica. The beaches, mountains, music and island cuisine make it a great place to visit. First of all, you must try the Jerk Chicken. Many resorts offer Jerk Shacks or Huts on the beach.  Another local favorite is the Jamaica Meat Patty or Meat Pie. It is similar to an Empanada and very tasty.  They offer plenty of rum drinks so be sure to try a Bob Marley or Jamaican Smile. If you are adventurous, Dunn River Falls is a must do. I also recommend Mystic Mountain. You take a ski lift to the top where you can zipline, ride the Jamaican Bobsled or enjoy the views. It is quite spectacular. The famous 7 mile beach in Negril offers some beautiful sand and amazing sunsets. There are many nice adult only and family resorts if you want to experience the Casual area of Jamaica. That is where I can help you decide on the best location and resort for your next trip to Jamaica!
