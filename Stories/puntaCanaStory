Punta Cana
If you want a destination for beautiful beaches, Punta Cana might be your place. Bavaro Beach has fine, white sand backed up by the turquoise water of the Caribbean Sea. If you head farther north, you find a variety of newer resorts where the Caribbean meets the Atlantic Ocean.  I highly recommend that you take excursions when visiting the Dominican Republic. Learn about their culture and lifestyle. Anything from how to make coffee and tobacco to where they live. Of course, any water lovers will enjoy scuba or snorkeling here. You can swim with the sting rays or take a ride on a party boat.  The Dominicans love baseball so feel free to strike up a conversation about the St Louis Cardinals or Albert Pujols.  Again, there is a resort for any traveler so we can discuss your wants and needs to find the perfect one!
