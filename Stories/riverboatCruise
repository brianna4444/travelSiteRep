American Queen Riverboat Cruise

One of my favorite trips to date is the American Queen Riverboat Cruise. I was fortunate to be invited to a luncheon several years ago. It was then that I fell in love with this small riverboat and decided I would be back. We were able to take a Mississippi itinerary from Natchez to New Orleans one early December. This is not a trip for everyone and it is geared toward seniors older than 65. Although much younger than the average passenger, it was one of my most memorable adventures. They offered nightly, entertaining shows that you wonâ€™t find on the larger ships. The rooms were reminiscent to the Victorian era. We stopped at several fascinating cities like Baton Rouge and Vicksburg. Of course, New Orleans is an exciting and beautiful city during the Christmas holidays. Let me know if this sounds like the right trip for you!
