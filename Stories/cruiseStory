Cruising
Often, I get asked about the difference in cruising and staying at an all-inclusive resort. Simple response is â€¦. do you want to wake up and put your feet in the sand OR wake up in a new destination? Cruising can be less or more expensive depending on a few factors. If you drive or fly to your destination, number of beverages consumed and whether you stay on the ship.  Now most cruises are NOT all-inclusive. The initial booking cost may start small BUT we need to add transportation to the port, recommended pre-night hotel, gratuities and beverage packages. There are additional charges on the ship such as specialty dining, bakery/coffee shops and Wi-Fi packages.
This is not to discourage you from cruising. I personally enjoy taking a cruise every few years.  It is a different experience. Some clients only prefer to cruise and that is great. The larger ships are like floating cities where it can take a week to navigate. You can drive go-kart tracks, utilize the rock-climbing walls, crash it up in the bumper cars or try the surf simulator on the newer vessels. The smaller ships can access more ports so you may visit more islands with those itineraries. Cruising is a great way to see more places without having to change hotels. I have different recommendations depending on your destination and ages of travelers. We will find the perfect cruise for your next vacation!
